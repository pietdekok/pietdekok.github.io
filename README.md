### This website is created for the ‘Computational Design Studio’ project of the minor ‘Spatial Computing for Architectural Design’. 
### Since the 1950s Rotterdam has been developing into an innovative modern city with new buildings being designed every year. At the Schiestraat, next to Rotterdam Central Station, an old parking terrain and square seem to be old-fashioned related to the more technologically advanced building surrounding the place. This gave us the opportunity to use the area as a base to create a new innovative building design, based on algorithmic generation, analyses, design requirements from the municipality and evaluation of building performances.
### The progress of the building has been divided into four different sections; ‘Planning’, ‘Configuring’, ‘Growing’, and ‘Designing’. Attached to the four sections, a codebook has been made to show all pseudocode and code that has been used in order to computationally construct building aspects.

# Planning
## Process
### Planning
#### Design Brief
#### The objective for this project is to develop a mixed-use building that is well integrated into the surrounding area and connects to (already existing) infrastructure. The target-audience for the program is students, elderly and starters, and for each of the groups different requirements have to be met. Besides the housing, a number of other program elements are integrated into the building, which can be seen in this paragraph.

### Location Analysis
#### The designed building is located in the heart of Rotterdam, next to ‘Rotterdam Centraal’ at the Schiestraat. This location is known for its night life and adjacency to the train tracks, which creates challenges preventing noise pollution. Surrounding buildings, which are known to be taller than usual, create wind gusts, which we need to take into account as well. Due to the fact that the building will be in the heart of the city, accessibility is a key factor in this project. The location is ideal for mixed-use developments for different groups with different interests and lifestyles. In the maps below, the position of the Aurora building in Rotterdam is shown. Two different scales are shown to visualize where in Rotterdam the building is exactly located:
